This is the Matlab code for absolute camera pose estimation from line correspondences using Branch-and-Bound.

Globally Optimal Camera Orientation Estimation from Line Correspondences by BnB algorith->: DOI: 10.1109/LRA.2020.3037843

###
##
The framework is copying from "Pose Estimation from Line Correspondences using Direct Linear Transformation". Its url is: https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ipribyl/DLT-based-PnL/

The plot function aboxplot.m (Advanced Box Plot for Matlab) is from http://alex.bikfalvi.com/research/advanced_matlab_boxplot/
###
##
We add our folder Ro_PnL, who has two functions: Ro_PnL and Ro_PnL_outlier.

try "Ro_PnL_test_outliers.m" and you will get a comparing result.

All code were tested in Matlab 2018a.
